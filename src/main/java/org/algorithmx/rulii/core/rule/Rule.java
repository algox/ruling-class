/**
 * Rule class encapsulates all the properties/methods of a Rule within the framework. A Rule consists of two parts
 * a Condition and a list of associated Actions. You can think of it as a If (Condition).. then Action(s).
 *
 * The Condition is stateless and should be able to execute many times without any side effects (idempotent).
 * The Action(s) can be stateful.
 *
 * A Rule Condition can be tested via :
 * the isPass(..), isFail(...) and test() methods. Those methods must be given the arguments the rule requires. These
 * methods are solely there for the purpose of executing them manually to test the Rule. You should use the RuleEngine
 * to automate the process of checking the Condition and running the associated Actions.
